## Background

This game serves as the Final Project for CS50, a class taught by David Malan offered through Harvard University. The primary goal of the assignment was to create a piece of software that is of interest to the student, while also creating something that outlives the course.

I decided to create a video game because of the Games Track towards the end of the course. It captured my imagination in a way that few things have done, so I was excited for the opportunity to create my own. I hope it brings you as much joy as I had in creating it.
